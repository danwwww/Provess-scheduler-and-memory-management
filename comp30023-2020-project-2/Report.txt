ReportCustomised Scheduling - Shortest Job First (SJF)The SJF scheduling algorithm is a non-preemptive algorithm that sorts all the processes according to the arrival time and then executes the process with minimum arrival time and minimum burst time.It works better in the scenarios where there are more shorter processes as the average turnaround time is lower. Because short processes do not have to wait for much longer time if they arrive after a very long process.It does not perform well when the long processes are more urgent as their priority is very low in this case.Customised Memory Management - Least Recently Used (LRU) 
The LRU page replacement algorithm is based on locality of reference where the page, which instructions have not been executed for the longest period of time, is replaced.
It performs well when there is an increasing in the number of page frames compared to other replacement algorithms because it is a stack-based algorithm and it is amenable to full statistical analysis. It also reduces the occurrence of page fault. 
It does not perform well in the scenarios where loops over large arrays are present.
